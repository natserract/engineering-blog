### Junior - Senior Responsibilities

The framework to take you from junior to senior developer:

Junior:

* Learn as much as possible
* Explore every part of the solution
* Listen and absorb all information from others
* Constantly ask for feedback and advice on how to grow

Intermediate:

* Take on as much work as possible
* Focus on going deep in one or two areas
* Become known as "The {insert area here} Person"
* Make mistakes, understand what went wrong, learn from it
* Get sh\*'t done

Senior:

* Become a great leader
* Know how to work with clients
* Focus on providing value, not output
* Understand every aspect of the solution
* Know how to get the most out of your team

### Junior - Senior Short Discussions:

* Junior Eng: Complains about "the requirements not being clear"
* Senior Eng: Takes responsibility to figure out what the requirements should be. They resolve ambiguity and communicate well.

### Junior - Senior Short Discussions 2:

* Junior Engineer: "I barely understand the problem, and I’m not even aware of how many tradeoffs there are or their possible implications."
* Engineer: "I understand the problem and have identified a number of tradeoffs, but I need a guiding hand to make the best decision."
* Senior Engineer: "I understand the problem and its root technical cause. I can quickly pick the best decision without any help."
* Principal Engineer: "I deeply understand the problem, have seen something similar in other domains, and can choose the decision that should prevent this problem from happening in the future."

### How do Senior engineers take features from start to finish?

1\. Ask why.

2\. Identify Minimum Actually Viable Product.

3\. Come up with the simplest technical solution.

4\. Break the first milestone into tasks.

5\. Implement feature flagging.

6\. Roll out incrementally.

7\. Validate assumptions and gather feedback.

8\. Improve and work on the next milestones.
